# MachineLearningUsingPython

Machine Learning is a latest __buzzword__ floating around. It desrves to, as it is one of the most interesting subfield of Computer Science.<br>
What does Machine Learning really means?<br>
It provides computers with __aility to learn__ without being eplicitly prgrammed.<br><br>

Let's try and understand in layman terms:
- Two task we do all the time, both consciously and subconsciously, is
  - To __categorize__ what we perceive through our senses (e.g. hot or cold paper cup, hot or cold ceramic mug)
  - To __predict__ the future based on our past experience and,
  - Perform new actions where predictions and categorization often occur in tandem
    - For e.g., we continue to increase the pressure holding a paper cup until we feel its just right and stop well before we crush it. If it was a cermaic cup it would be a quick grip no concern of crushing. 
    - The action is driven by some for of reward(e.g. the taste of a drink).
  

We do both these tasks - __categorization__ and __prediction__.<br>
If we were to visualize categorization and predictions, they look like __two sides of the same coin__:
- In the case of categorization a __line is drawn separating__ the data points -  cats and dogs.
- In the case of prediction a line is drawn throught he given data points and often __used to estimate__ if it would continue to grow/fall.

### Telecom Churn Prediction
![image.jpg](image/telecom.jpg)<br><br>
- A churn with respect to the Telecom industry, is defined as the percentage of subscribers moving from a specific service ot a service provider to another in a period of time.
- Research shows that the companies have an avergae churn of 1.9 to 2 percent month on month and annualized churn ranging from 10 to 60 percent.
- An effort to build a model which helps in reducing the churn rate for a telecom company.


### Credit Fraud Detection
![image.jpg](image/fraud.jpg)<br><br>
- Credit card fraud is a wide-ranging term for theft and fraud committed using or involving a payment card, such aas credit or debit card, as  fraudulent source of funds in a transaction. 
- The purpose may be to obtain goods without paying, or to obtain unautorized funds from an account.
- Credit card fraud is also and adjunt to identity theft.
- Building a robust model usiso that credit card companies are able to recognize the fraudulent card transactions so that customets are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

### Spam detection

- This is a begineer's example of document classification task which involves classifying an email as spam or not spam mail.
- Spam box in your Gmail account is the ebst example of this.
