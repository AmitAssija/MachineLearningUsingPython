Machine Learning is a latest buzzword floating around. It desrves to, as it is one of the most interesting subfield of COmputer Science.<br>
What does Machine Learning really means?<br>
It provides computers with ability to learn without being eplicitly prgrammed.<br><br>

Let's try and understand in layman terms:
- Two task we do all the time, both consciously and subconsciously, is
  - To __categorize__ what we perceive through our senses (e.g. hot or cold paper cup, hot or cold ceramic mug)
  - To __predict__ the future based on our past experience and,
  -  perform new actions where predictions and categorixation often occur in tandem( e.g. we continue to increase the pressure holding a paper cup until we fel its just right and stop well before we crush it. If it was a cermaic cup it would be a quick grip no concern of crushing). The action is driven by some for of reward(e.g. the taste of a drink).
  

We do both these tasks - __categorization__ and __prediction__.<br>
If we were to visualize categorization and predictions, they look like two sides of the same coin:
- In the case of categorization a line is drawn separating the data points -  cats and dogs.
- In the case of prediction a line is drawn throught he given data points and often used to estimate if it would continue to grow/fall.
